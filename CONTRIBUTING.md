## Commit Messages

We're using `standard-version` for changelog generation and releases. Have a look at the conventions [here].

The following additional prefixes, are used as well.

* `docs`
* `chore`
* `tests`
* `demo` (regarding the dummy app, since it's made public)

## Releasing a new version

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version for instructions on generating change logs and commit formats.

```bash
npm run release
```

Will do the work of generating the changelog and bumping the version, tagging.
You just need to copy the command it provides to push and publish the changes.

## Github Pages/Demo

Build by checking out the relevant branch, since the test dummy app
is actually the demo app.

Run the following command:

```no-highlight
ember github-pages:commit --message <message describing demo release>
```
